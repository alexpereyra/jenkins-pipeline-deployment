# jenkins-pipeline-deployment
this repo will serve as the master for a jenkins pipeline previously built for a code deployment. I will be documenting it so that it can be used by others

## build jenkins server

- AWS documentation for this build can be found in whitepapers so I won't be going into the details. See of commands below to build a baseline.

- Build a amz linux
- ssh into your instance
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<your_key.pem> ec2-user@ec2<ip_of_ec2>.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

- If your distro of linux does not have wget...you can download and install it to use commands below.
```
sudo yum install wget
```

- Now we can install and configure Jenkins
```
sudo yum update â€“y
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkinsci.org/redhat/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
sudo yum install jenkins -y
sudo service jenkins start
```
- Head to the directory below and grab the admin password as you will need it in the next step.
```
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

- Now you connect to the Jenkins interface via the servers public dns over port 8080 and use the admin password to connect.
```
http://<your_server_public_DNS>:8080
```

- That's it! Now that your Jenkins instance is up and running. We'll go setup a certificate and Route53 alias for a cleaner/secure url. This step is optional if you don't have a domain registar or don't require SSL.
